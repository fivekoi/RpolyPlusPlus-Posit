 * The series was first described formally by Agronomof in 1914, but its first unintentional 
 * use is in the Origin of species by Charles R. Darwin. In the example of illustrating the 
 * growth of elephant population, he relied on the calculations made by his son, George H. Darwin. 
 * The term tribonacci was suggested by Feinberg in 1963.
 * 
 * The tribonacci constant, the only real solution to the equation x^3 - x^2 - x - 1 = 0, 
 * which is related to tribonacci sequences (in which U_n = U_n-1 + U_n-2 + U_n-3) as 
 * the Golden Ratio is related to the Fibonacci sequence and its generalizations. 
 * This ratio also appears when a snub cube is inscribed in an octahedron or a cube, 
 * by analogy once again with the appearance of the Golden Ratio when an icosahedron 
 * is inscribed in an octahedron. [John Sharp, 1997]"
 *
 * The tribonacci constant corresponds to the Golden Section in a 
 *          tripartite division 1 = u_1 + u_2 + u_3 of a unit line segment; 
 * i.e., if 1/u_1 = u_1/u_2 = u_2/u_3 = c, c is the tribonacci constant. - Seppo Mustonen, Apr 19 2005
 *
 * The other two polynomial roots are the complex-conjugated pair 
 * -0.4196433776070805662759262... +- i* 0.60629072920719936925934... - R. J. Mathar, Oct 25 2008

/*
 * this begs the question: should the argument and the return value
 * be different types? Clearly, the Tribonacci number will not be
 * representable by the type of the argument as it will be greater
 * than the maximum value associated with the argument type.
 * 
 * To support consistency the answer is yes, as we could write a
 * statement that will yield a consistent answer. Problem is that
 * it would also require a computational relationship between the
 * types that would be rediculously expensive to compute without
 * an analytical formula.
 * 
 * I have settled on a projection from the unsigned ints to a target
 * number system to side step all this complexity.
